>In Euclidean plane geometry, a tangent line to a circle is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point, never entering the circle's interior. Tangent lines to circles form the subject of several theorems, and play an important role in many geometrical constructions and proofs. Since the tangent line to a circle at a point P is perpendicular to the radius to that point, theorems involving tangent lines often involve radial lines and orthogonal circles.

```
struct pt {
    double x, y;

    pt operator- (pt p) {
        pt res = { x-p.x, y-p.y };
        return res;
    }
};

struct circle : pt {
    double r;
};

struct line {
    double a, b, c;
};

const double EPS = 1E-9;

double sqr (double a) {
    return a * a;
}
